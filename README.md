House Price Prediction using XGBoost Regression

This project focuses on predicting house prices using the Boston House Price dataset. The dataset consists of 13 features that influence house pricing, and the model employs the XGBoost regression algorithm to achieve high accuracy in predictions.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Boston House Price dataset, which includes 13 features such as:

1. CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town.

2. ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.

3. INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.

4. CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).

5. NOX: Nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million).

6. RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling.

7. AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940.

8. DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.

9. RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways.

10. TAX: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000.

11. PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.

12. B: 1000(Bk â€“ 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of Black residents by town.

13. LSTAT: Percentage of lower status of the population.
